**Disclaimer:**
Some of the images may look a little different because I used a sample size of the data. I trimmed the data to 50,000 rows only because Tableau was running too slow with the amount of data that I started with and it kept crashing. 

**Purpose:**

  Purpose of this analysis is to determine when the most opportune moments are for CitiBike rentals. Using this data to determine when they need to have more bikes on hand. 


**Summary:**

Men are more likely to ride CitiBikes than women. 

CitiBike rides declined rapidly for a duration longer than 20 minutes. 

Thursday showed the most CitiBike rides recorded of all the days in my dataset (again, could be skewed since I shrunk dataset down to 50k records only)

Men subscribed to the CitiBike service 3 times more than women subrscribed to the service.
